# TriviaWithFriends

This game was designed to both solve a problem in my life (playing a synchronous game of trivia over video chat with friends while keeping score), and allow me to
learn some new technologies (MERN stack).

Technologies utilized: React.js, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB

Technologies soon-to-be utilized: Socket.io for handling question responses, Heroku for deployment

This is a work in progress. All of the create, read, update, delete functionality has been built. The 'gameplay' portion of the application has not been built yet.
