Trivia With Friends

This game was designed to both solve a problem in my life (playing a synchronous game of trivia over video chat with friends while keeping score), and allow me to
learn some new technologies. 

Technologies utilized: React.js, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB

Technologies soon-to-be utilized: Socket.io, Heroku

This is a work in progress. All of the CRUD functionality has been built. The 'gameplay' portion of the application has not been built yet.
