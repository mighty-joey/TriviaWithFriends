Trivia With Friends

This game was designed to both solve a problem in my life (playing a synchronous game of trivia over video chat with friends while keeping score), and allow me to
learn some new technologies. 

Technologies Utilized Include:
-React.js
-JavaScript
-Express
-MongoDB
-socket.io (soon)

This is a work in progress. All of the CRUD functionality has been built. The 'gameplay' portion of the application has not been built yet.
